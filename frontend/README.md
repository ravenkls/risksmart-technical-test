# RiskSmart Tech Test GraphQL Frontend

## About the Project

I've implemented the frontend using React. There are unit and integration tests for the majority of the components.

There are 2 ways in which you can view the employees, in a standard table format, or in a graph view.

## Setup

### Quick Start
To set the project up, you should hopefully (ðŸ¤ž) be able to just run `docker compose up` to start the project. Failing that, you can manually build the project using `yarn install` and `yarn start`.

When the project is running, you will be able to navigate to https://localhost:5173/ to view the app. Make sure you have the backend running at the same time (on http://localhost:3000)!
